Helping you build tech skills & land a cloud job! ☁️

Hi there! I'm Lucy, an Ex-AWS Solutions Architect. 👩‍💻

My AWS journey started when I was 20 - I joined AWS as an intern in 2020 (during the pandemic) and become an Associate Solutions Architect after my internship.

This "Tech With Lucy" channel was born out of a desire to help others start a career in Cloud industry. After 2 years working as an AWS Solutions Architect, I quit my job to create videos full-time! 📸

If you have any video suggestions - please let me know!
